<!-- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computser programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

constructor es5, is basically a function 
When this keyword in trick mode, it doesnâ€™t point to global object, undefined.

Store common functions inside prototype rather than the constructor object itselfs


Class es6

Put prototype function inside class directly; static functions need no instantiate; static functions/properties belong to the class, not the objects



Call,apply, bind -->
